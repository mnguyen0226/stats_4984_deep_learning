## 1. AI, ML, DL
- Artificial Intelligence: is human intelligence exhibited by machines
- Machine Learning: the practice of using algorithms to learn from data, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.
- Deep Learning: Using deep neural networks to implement machine learning.

## 2. Traditional ML
- Supervised Learning: 
    - Regression Model (Y is continuous): Linear Regression,...
    - Classification Model (Y is discrete): Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Linear Discriminate Analysis,...

## 3. Deep Learning
- Deep Learning uses deep neural network that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions.
    - Supervised Learning: Fully-Connected Neural Networks,...
    - Unsupervised Learning: Auto-Encoder, Variational Auto-Encoders, GAN,...
    - Reinforcement Learning: Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## 5. Brief Review of Python Programming
- Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new types of object, allowing new instances of that types to be made.
- Constructors in Python:
    - Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions as they have special meaning.
    - Of one particular interest is the __init__() function. This special function gets called whenever a new object of that class is instantiated.
